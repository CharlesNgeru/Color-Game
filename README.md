#Basic Color Guessing Game Web Application

## Motivation
I made this project while I was learning VanillaJS, and I succeeded in doing so, the web-application is awesome and the code is as "dry" as I could make it.

<b>Built with</b>

## Features
The Application can be used for offline purposes since the libraries are sited offline

## Installation
Just open/run the index.html in your browser by double clicking it or right-clicking then choose open with your browser. It is as easy as that!!

## How to use?
This app is a color guessing game using the RGB format to provide a spectrum of colors that are formed by the combination of either of red, blue and green in the range of 0 - 255.

It is has two modes Easy and Hard. Easy has three choices while Hard has six choices to choose from.

The guessing game by itself is easy, I'll give you a hint: red + greeen = yellow, red + blue = pink, blue + green = cyan, red + blue + green = white.
